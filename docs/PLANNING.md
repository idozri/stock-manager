# Stock Management Website - Project Planning

## �� Project Overview

A comprehensive Stock Management Website that allows users to manage their stock portfolios, view real-time stock data, and explore market information. Built with a modern tech stack using Nx monorepo architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend (Next.js App)

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4 with App Router
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v7.2.0 for consistent design
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with typed hooks
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for API calls
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + MUI components

### Backend (NestJS API)

- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **API Integration**: Financial Modeling Prep API for stock data
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Caching**: Built-in cache manager for API responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttler middleware for API protection

  - Financial metrics (P/E ratio, EPS, market cap)
  - Company information (description, sector, CEO, website)
  - Technical indicators (moving averages)

### 4. Market Data & Discovery

✅ **Completed Features**:

- Dashboard with market data tabs:
  - Most Active stocks (highest volume)
  - Top Gainers (best performing stocks)
  - Biggest Losers (worst performing stocks)
  - Stock Search functionality
- Pagination for large result sets
- Real-time market data updates

### 5. Navigation & User Experience

✅ **Completed Features**:

- Individual stock detail pages at `/stock/[symbol]`
- Route protection with Next.js middleware
- Loading states and error handling throughout the app

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### User Portfolio Collection

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  sessionId: string,          // User's session identifier
  userName: string,           // User's display name
  stocks: [
    {
      symbol: string,         // Stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
      addedAt: Date          // When stock was added to portfolio
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Stock Cache Collection (for API optimization)

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  symbol: string,
  data: {
    // Cached stock quote and company profile data
    quote: StockQuoteDto,
    profile: CompanyProfileDto
  },
  lastUpdated: Date,
  expiresAt: Date
}
```

## 🎨 Design System

### UI Components Used

- **Material-UI Components**: AppBar, Drawer, Cards, Buttons, Typography
- **Color Scheme**: Material Design colors with semantic meaning
  - Primary: Blue (#1976d2) for main actions
  - Success: Green (#2e7d32) for positive changes/add actions
  - Error: Red (#d32f2f) for negative changes/remove actions
- **Icons**: Material Icons for intuitive user interactions

### Component Architecture

- **Layout Components**: MainLayout with responsive sidebar
- **Feature Components**:
  - Portfolio: StockList, StockCard components
  - Dashboard: MostActiveTab, TopGainersTab, BiggestLosersTab, SearchResultsTab
  - Stock Details: Comprehensive StockDetails component
- **Shared Components**: Loading states, error boundaries

## 🔧 Development Guidelines Followed

### Code Organization

✅ **Implemented**:

- Files kept under 500 lines through component splitting
- Feature-based folder structure in `src/components/`
- Separation of concerns (API layer, components, contexts, store)
- Consistent import patterns with relative imports

### API Integration Strategy

✅ **Implemented**:

- Rate limiting awareness with proper error handling
- 5-minute caching for stock quotes, 1-hour for company profiles
- Graceful fallback to demo API key when none provided
- Background data refresh with TanStack Query

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations Implemented

✅ **Completed**:

- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Redux Toolkit for optimized state management
- Component-level loading states to prevent UI blocking
- API response caching in backend (MongoDB + in-memory)
- Database indexing for portfolio queries

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

✅ **Completed**:

- Environment variable management for API keys
- Input validation with class-validator
- Rate limiting on backend endpoints (100 req/min)
- CORS configuration for frontend/backend communication
- Route protection with Next.js middleware
- Error message sanitization

## 📚 Shared Type System

✅ **Implemented**:

- Centralized interfaces in `@stocks-manager/interfaces` library
- Type safety across frontend and backend
- Consistent data structures throughout the application

### Key Interfaces

- `UserSessionDto` & `UserContextType` - User session management
