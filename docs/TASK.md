## 🔧 Post-Completion Maintenance (January 2025)

### ✅ Dependency Resolution Issue Fixed (January 30, 2025)

**Issue Discovered**: API build failing due to missing dependencies

- `webpack-cli` was not installed, causing build command failure
- `@nestjs/mongoose` and `mongoose` packages were missing from API dependencies

**Resolution Applied**:

- ✅ Installed `webpack-cli` as devDependency at root level
- ✅ Installed `@nestjs/mongoose` and `mongoose` in `apps/stocks-manager-api`
- ✅ Verified API successfully starts and runs on `http://localhost:3005/api`
